# Logistic-Regression

It comes under Supervised Learning technique.
It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.

Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. *The categorical dependent variable here refers to as a binary variable*

Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc.
But instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.

It is a significant machine learning algorithm 
because it has the ability to provide probabilities and classify new data using continuous and discrete datasets.

Note: Logistic regression uses the concept of predictive modeling as regression; 
therefore, it is called logistic regression, but is used to classify samples;
Therefore, it falls under the classification algorithm.
