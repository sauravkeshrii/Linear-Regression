# Linear-Regression

 Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.
 The linear regression model provides a sloped straight line representing the relationship between the variables.
 
 Types of Linear Regression:-
 
 a. Simple Linear Regression:
If a single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Simple Linear Regression.
 b. Multiple Linear regression:
If more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Multiple Linear Regression.
